# Workshop 1

For this program, I implemented several classes, including User, Client, Manager, and VideoGame, along with various arcade machine classes like DanceRevolution and VirtualReality.

The User class serves as a base for both Client and Manager, enabling user profile management and administrative functionalities. The VideoGame class allows users to input game details, while the Factory Design Pattern is used in the FactoryMachines and PredefinedMachines classes to create different arcade machines based on user selections.

At the end, users receive a summary of their selections and total price, with all purchases recorded for easy tracking.
